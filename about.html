<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Elizabeth Oni. I am a web developer at the beginning of my coding journey, with a strong interest in Vue.js and a background in Chemistry. 
  Transitioning from chemistry to coding has been an exciting adventure, and I am dedicated to mastering this new skill set.</p>

<p>I believe in putting my all into everything I do, whether it is learning new programming languages or developing my first web applications. 
  I am passionate about growing in this field and eager to take on new challenges as I continue to learn and evolve.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I am an avid learner, always exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skills. 
  I believe in the power of continuous growth, both personally and professionally,
  and I am excited to keep evolving in this ever-changing digital landscape.</p>
<p>
  Let us connect and share our coding journeys or explore new opportunities together
